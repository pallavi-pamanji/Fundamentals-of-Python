Legs              Rs. 180.90
Can you write a program to do the given task?
Sample Input : 20 10 14 3 9
Sample Output : yes

solution:
A= int(input())
B = int(input())
C = int(input())
D= int(input())
E = int(input())
br = 350.34*A
vs = 230.90*B
sn = 190.55*C
ar = 125.30*D
le = 180.90*E
total = br+vs+sn+ar+le
if(total<15000):
    print("yes")
else:
    print("no")

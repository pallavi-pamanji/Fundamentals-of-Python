Program to find if the given numbers are Friendly pair or not (Amicable or not) is discussed here.Friendly Pair are two or more numbers with a common abundance.
For example,6 and 28 are Friendly Pair.
(Sum of divisors of 6)/6 = (Sum of divisors of 28)/28.
Sample Input:
6
28
Sample Output:
Friendly Pair

solution:
n1 = int(input())
n2 = int(input())
sum1 = 0
sum2 = 0
for i in range(1, n1):
   if(n1%i==0):
      sum1+= i
div1 = sum1/n1
for i in range(1, n2):
   if(n2%i==0):
      sum2+= i
div2 = sum2/n2
if(div1==div2):
    print("Friendly pair")
else:
    print("Not friendly pair")

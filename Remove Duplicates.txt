Accept the values into the list using a for loop and insert them into the list. Use a for loop to traverse through the elements of the list.

20
20
20  
[10, 20]

solution:
n=int(input())
ls1,ls2=[],[]
for i in range(n):
     a=int(input())
     ls1.append(a)
for i in ls1:
     if i not in ls2:
         ls2.append(i)
print(ls2)

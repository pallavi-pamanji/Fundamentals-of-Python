The environmental eco club  have discovered a new Amoeba that grows in the order of a Fibonacci series every month.
They are exhibiting their amoeba in a national conference. They want to know the size of the amoeba at a particular time instant.
If a particular month’s index is given can you write a  program that displays the amoeba’s size……???
Note: The size of the amoeba on month 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,7 ..will be 
Sample input and Output 1:
Enter the number of Months :
7
The amoeba size is 8
Sample input and Output 2:
Enter the number of Months :
12
The amoeba size is 89

solution:
month = int(input("Enter the number of  months:\n"))
if(month==1):
  print("The amoeba size is 0")
if(month==2):
  print("The amoeba size is 1")
if(month==3):
  print("The amoeba size is 1")
if(month==4):
  print("The amoeba size is 2")
if(month==5):
  print("The amoeba size is 3")
if(month==6):
  print("The amoeba size is 5")
if(month==7):
  print("The amoeba size is 8")
if(month==8):
  print("The amoeba size is 13")
if(month==9):
  print("The amoeba size is 21")
if(month==10):
  print("The amoeba size is 34")
if(month==11):
  print("The amoeba size is 55")
if(month==12):
  print("The amoeba size is 89")

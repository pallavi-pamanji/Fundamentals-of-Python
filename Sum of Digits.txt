Write a program to find the sum of digits in a given number. Program to find the sum of digits of the given number is discussed here. 
For example, let the input number be 719. The sum of digits of 719 = 7 + 1 + 9 = 17
Sample Input : 719
Sample Output : 17

solution:
n = int(input())
sum = 0
for digit in str(n):
  sum+=int(digit)
print(sum)

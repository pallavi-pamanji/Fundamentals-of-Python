Write program to reverse a number is discussed here.We can reverse a number using loop and arithmetic operators in both iterative and recursive approaches. 
Sample Input: 
13579
Sample Output: 
97531

solution:
n = int(input())
rev = 0
while(n > 0):
    a = n % 10
    rev = rev * 10 + a
    n = n // 10
print(rev)

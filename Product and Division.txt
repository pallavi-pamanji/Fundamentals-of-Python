Write a python program to get 2 numbers from the user and calculate their product,quotient and remainder using '*','/'and'%' operators respectively.
Print the corresponding product,quotient and remainder of the numbers as output in the console. 
Input format: 
First input: an integer
Second input: an integer Output format: 
The first output will be the product of two integers 
The second output will be the quotient 
The third output will be the remainder
Sample Input:
50
10
Sample Output:
500
5
0

solution:
a = int(input(" enter a number "))
b = int(input(" enter a number "))
p = a*b
q = a//b
r = a%b
print("the product of two numbers is:",p)
print("the quotient of two numbers is:",q)
print("the remainder of two numbers is:",r)

A microwave oven manufacturer recommends that when heating two items, add 50% to the heating time,and when heating three items double the heating time.
Heating more than three items at once is not recommended. Write a program that asks the user for the number of items and the single-item heating time.
The program then writes out the recommended heating time.
Sample Input and Output 1:
Enter the number of items
2
Enter the single item heating time
5.0
The recommended heating time is 7.50
Sample Input and Output 2:
Enter the number of items
4
Enter the single item heating time
5.0
Number of items is more

solution:
item = int(input("Enter the number of items\n"))
sht = float(input("Enter the single item heating time\n"))
if(item==2):
    ht = sht+(0.5)*sht
    print("The recommended heating time is","%.2f" %ht)
elif(item==3):
    ht = sht*sht
    print("The recommended heating time is","%.2f" %ht)
else:
    print("Number of items is more")
